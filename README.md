This project explores how deep learning models perceive satellite images—and how we can interpret those decisions using **Integrated Gradients**.  

By combining **CNNs**, **transfer learning**, and **XAI techniques**, the model classifies land types from aerial images and reveals *what it’s actually looking at* when it makes decisions.
> 🔍 For full methodology, background, model architecture, and discussion of results, see the [full report.](./Full-Report.pdf)

The final classifiers achieved:  
- **99.4% accuracy** on the 7-class general land type classifier  
- **99.5% accuracy** on the 35-class fine-grained classifier

## Example Visualizations

Below are examples of Integrated Gradients attributions for correctly and incorrectly classified satellite images.  
Brighter red areas show which pixels contributed most to the model’s prediction.

The **first image** below is an example of an incorrect classification by the model, of which there were very few (just 0.6% of the test set).

## Notebooks

Two models were developed and trained using the same XAI pipeline:

- 🏷️ [7-Class Classifier](./notebooks/7-Class-Classifier-cleaned.ipynb)  
  Groups satellite land types into general categories (e.g., *urban*, *water*, *woodland*)

- 🏷️ [35-Class Classifier](./notebooks/35-Class-Classifier-cleaned.ipynb)  
  A fine-grained classifier with detailed subcategories (e.g., *river*, *shrubland*, *ocean*)
